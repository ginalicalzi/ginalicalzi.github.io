	<div class="shmerykowskypara">Ms. Shmerykowsky will always be one of my favorite teachers I’ve ever had. She has been so influential not only when it comes to my art, but my life. I always felt like she challenged me as a student and did such a good job showing me the ropes about the basic principles and foundation of art. She really believed in me and always gave me confidence or made me feel good about what I was doing which was so important to me because I am really self critical. I think about her all the time when I’m doing projects or reminiscing on life before college and how she would go to great lengths to make sure my class was challenged. The top two pictures are of a note she gave me on the last day of school. She gave everyone in my AP Art History class this kind of card which included what artwork reminded her of us that we learned about that year. For me she chose “David” by Bernini and it really touched my heart and made me feel good about myself. I keep that note in a little box with the rest of my memorabilia because her words were really important to me at the time and still are. It gives me a lot of comfort knowing there was someone who believed in me so much at that time of my life. The other two notes I included are from my portfolio book and my yearbook. She will always be a light in my life and I hope she knows how much of an impact she has made on me, and that I will never forget her or anything she has taught me.</div>
