	<div class="buccinopara">I will always remember Mrs. Buccino as a dedicated and passionate teacher who always did the most for her students. The note she wrote was from my portfolio book that my teachers gifted me and I designed at the end of the year. I went on the art department Italy trip with her as well as my other art teachers which is where I really got to know them. She always complimented me and made me feel really good about myself and my work even when I didnâ€™t have her as a teacher. She always went out of her way to make powerpoints and explain things to us or to keep class interesting. I laugh when I think about how she used to be really hectic and busy and how I could relate to that especially in my junior year. She has taught me a lot and I am so grateful I got to have her as a teacher.</div>
