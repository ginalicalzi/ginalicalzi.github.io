	<div class="caitlinpara">I’ve known Caitlin Pedote since I went to Pre-K at my old elementary school. We were always friends but we were really close from 5th-9th grade. We don’t see each other a lot anymore but that doesn’t mean I forgot any of the memories we made. We just happened to go on separate paths, but I still appreciate her for the time she was in my life. I kept this card that she gave me from my 13th birthday because it made me feel special to have a friend that would write a lot on my birthday card. She wrote about some inside jokes we had and some other random things. It’s a weird feeling to read that now and remember it being so relevant at the time, compared to now where I can’t even recall some of the stuff she said in the card. I will always remember Caitlin as a sweet girl who was one of the first people who I really considered a close friend.</div>
