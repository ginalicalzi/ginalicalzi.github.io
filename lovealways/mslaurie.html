	<div class="mslauriepara">I’ve had Ms. Laurie as a dance teacher for as long as I can remember. She’s taught me tap, jazz, and ballet. It was hard for me to leave my dance studio in 2019 after having been there for almost all of my life, but I know I will always be able to visit. She gave me this card on our last day of dance class and it was really emotional for me knowing I was going to be going through a massive change in my life. Not only was I graduating high school and going to college, but I was leaving my friends and not going to dance anymore, which I have done since I was three years old. I will always appreciate Ms. Laurie and everything she taught me.</div>
