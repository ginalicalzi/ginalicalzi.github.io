	<div class="grandmapara">My Grandma Marie is a very special person in my life. She has always been at all my family events since I was a kid, and for as long as I can remember, she has always given me cards with little notes in them. These cards are especially important to me because one was from my 16th birthday and one was from my last dance recital after 15 years of dance. In the card for my 16th birthday, she wrote “what a lovely young lady you are,” which made me feel really special on my birthday. The other card from my dance recital was important to me because she has been at every one of my recitals since I was a baby so it was upsetting that she could not make it due to chemotherapy treatment. I love my grandma and all the little cards and gifts she always gives me to remind me that I am loved.</div>
