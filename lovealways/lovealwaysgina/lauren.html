	<div class="laurenpara">Lauren, my sister, is a pain in my butt but I love her occasionally. She wrote the top left handwritten note in the morning one day attempting to mimic me. Some of the stuff was true, most wasn’t, but it did make me laugh. She will always think you do nothing even if you traveled to the moon and back in a day and that’s one of the reasons I found the note humorous. I couldn’t help but laugh at her when she gave it to me. My sister is a bipolar version of my mom, which to say the least, is a handful. In the texts above, you can see that we text each other frequently and most of the time it’s either her bothering me or vice versa.</div>
