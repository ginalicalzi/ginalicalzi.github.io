	<div class="avapara">I will never forget the first time I met Ava Occhipinti. I was at my friend Mariarose’s house for her 13th birthday party in the 7th grade and this scrawny girl walks up to me and says “You’re Gina right? Don’t you live on **th Avenue? I do too! Let’s dance together.” I laugh so hard when I think about that because it was so… well I can’t even explain it… just so Ava. We saw each other sometimes because of Mariarose but it wasn’t until freshman year when we really started to become close friends. We walked home from the bus stop together every day, and since we lived down the block from each other, we talked the whole way home. I am so thankful that we went to school together and had the chance to get so close. The first top left note is what she wrote in my yearbook, and although it’s not a super long note, it’s something that she would write since she’s not a woman of many words. The text conversations we have once in a blue moon are also pretty funny when I answer quickly.</div>
