	<div class="auntjoannepara">I will always remember my Aunt Joanne as a bubbly and loving woman. From when I was little to now she has always been a light in my family’s life, even when she has faced trials and tribulations. She is a strong person and I will always admire that about her. One of the things that I will always appreciate is the fact that she and my grandma never forget my birthday. On the card above, she wrote “Sorry that I’m late with your gift,” which didn’t matter to me at all because she has always remembered whether it was late or on time. My birthday is December 28th and sometimes I find it blending in with the holidays so it is a nice reminder every year when she sends me a card.</div>
