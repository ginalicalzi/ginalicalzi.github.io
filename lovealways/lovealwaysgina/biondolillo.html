	<div class="biondolillopara">When I was in the 8th grade, I got accepted into Mr. Biondolillo’s freshman art honors class at my high school. I had a really positive and fulfilling experience being exposed to all of the new things he taught me about art and art history. I also tagged along on an Italy trip with him and the rest of the art department where we made fond memories and witnessed lots of beautiful pieces from “The David” by MichelAngelo to “The Birth of Venus” by Botticelli. I will always remember him as a witty and bold teacher who cares for his students and wants to make sure they do their best. I appreciated when he would show us her personal art as well because he was such a wonderful and detailed painter. He helped me along the beginning of my journey as an artist and I will never forget that. </div>
