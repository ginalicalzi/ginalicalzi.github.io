	<div class="jessicapara">I met Jessica Lee freshman year in high school in an art honors class I took. We sat by each other for the whole year but we didnâ€™t really talk too much. We really started to get close in my junior year when we both took lots of art classes. It started in our drawing from life class when we sat next to each other and started talking. As the first day of school went on we saw that we had so many classes together (I think it was three art classes and an english class). One of the classes we really bonded in was our Advanced Drawing and Painting X period class which was three hours after school every Wednesday. We began to talk about schoolwork together and ended up spending lots of frees together. She was so funny and I found that I was really happy to have someone like her in my art classes to talk to. I became close friends with her and another girl named Emma. I really miss her and Emma a lot, but they are doing well and I wish them the best.</div>
