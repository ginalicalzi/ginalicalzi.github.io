	<div class="hafkerpara">In my junior year, I had Mr. Hafker for English 11 and I loved every minute of it. I was really inspired by how passionate he was about every book we read and I really appreciated how understanding and thoughtful he was. He always complimented me on my artwork and essays and I will never forget that. The two notes I included from him are from my yearbook and my copy of “The Little Portion,” which was a collection of student poems from my senior year. He included some of my artwork in the book which I really appreciated as well.</div>
