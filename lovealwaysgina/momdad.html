	<div class="momdadpara">This goes without saying, but my mom and dad are very important people in my life. They do everything for me and have always made sure that I lived a good life. My mom goes out of her way to do things for me and always ensures that I have the best of the best. My dad always supports me and manages to squeeze life lessons into everythingâ€¦ and I mean everything. The top card was given to me during my last recital after 15 years of dance that they allowed me to experience. The text message was from my dad, it was a speech he made during my 16th birthday party with my family.</div>
