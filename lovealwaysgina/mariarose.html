	<div class="mariarosepara">To me, Mariarose Beccarelli was the first person that I could ever call my best friend. Our friendship started in the 6th grade when we saw each other almost every day because we were on the same basketball teams, and because we began to bond over our obsession with One Direction. We are still close to this day and as you can see from the text conversations that probably make no sense to any outside viewers, she always has me dying of laughter. What happened was that she made a typo and instead of saying “filter” she said “filet,” and don’t ask me why, but I immediately thought of the old McDonald’s commercial with the song “Filet O’Fish.” We have this weird type of humor in that we found that hysterical and laughed over text for at least a half-hour. We just have the best conversations over text sometimes it feels like we should be comedians. I love her so much and we have come so far, which is also why I included the handwritten note she scribbled in my high school yearbook. We have been friends for what seems like forever now and the memory of my life before becoming close to her is a little blurry, but I wouldn’t change it for the world.</div>
